            Getting to know your business is what we do best. Because nothing is
            more frustrating than calling your service provider and having to
            reinvent the wheel. Which is why someone who knows your business
            will pick up the phone when you call, email, or chat. Plus, you’ll
            be assigned a project team that will go wide and deep, getting to
            know every aspect of your company’s IT model.

              At Parachute we’ve fixed the things our clients told us they can’t
              stand about Managed IT Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              The impersonal feel, the lack of effort to understand your
              business , the nonexistent transparency about cost, the help desk
              that just isn’t responsive, and the mystery about what the random
              IT guy in the network room is actually doing.
            </p>
            <p class="title subtitle">
              If you’re looking for Managed IT Services that feel IN-HOUSE,
              you’ll love Parachute.
